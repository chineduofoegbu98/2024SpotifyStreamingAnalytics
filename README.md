## What I Built

Two SQL projects analysing Spotify's most streamed songs:

### 1. Data Quality Assessment
- **Problem**: 4% of data had corrupted text fields
- **Solution**: Built quality metrics and cleaning process
- **Result**: 96% usable data identified

### 2. Cross Platform Analysis
- **Problem**: Which platform should artists prioritise?
- **Solution**: Compared TikTok, Spotify, and YouTube performance
- **Result**: Clear strategic recommendations based on data
